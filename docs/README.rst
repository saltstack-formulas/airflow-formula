Commit messages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Commit message formatting is significant!!**

Please see `How to contribute <https://github.com/saltstack-formulas/.github/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.rst>`_ for more details.

pre-commit
^^^^^^^^^^

`pre-commit <https://pre-commit.com/>`_ is configured for this formula, which you may optionally use to ease the steps involved in submitting your changes.
First install  the ``pre-commit`` package manager using the appropriate `method <https://pre-commit.com/#installation>`_, then run ``bin/install-hooks`` and
now ``pre-commit`` will run automatically on each ``git commit``. ::

  $ bin/install-hooks
  pre-commit installed at .git/hooks/pre-commit
  pre-commit installed at .git/hooks/commit-msg

Special notes
-------------

Archlinux: You need Salt python3 installed::

    pacman -Sy base-devel curl; curl -sSL https://aur.archlinux.org/cgit/aur.git/snapshot/salt-py3.tar.gz | tar xz; cd salt-py3; makepkg -Crsf; sudo -s;pacman -U salt-py3-*.pkg.tar*

Everybody: The following `top.sls` works using Saltstack-formulas community::

  base:
  '*':
    - mysql        # .clean
    - postgres     # .clean
    - rabbitmq     # .clean
    - redis        # .clean
    - airflow      # .clean

Apache-Airflow (most extras) is verified on Ubuntu, CentOS7, OpenSUSE15; (Archlinux, k8s, MacOS/Windows is planned).

Available states
----------------

.. contents::
   :local:

``airflow``
^^^^^^^^^^^^

*Meta-state (This is a state that includes other states)*.

This installs the airflow package,
manages the airflow configuration file and then
starts the associated airflow service.

``airflow.package``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This state will install the airflow pip package only.

``airflow.archive``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This state will install the airflow archive only. ** Not implemented ** placeholder for potential windows support ***

``airflow.config``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This state will configure the airflow service and has a dependency on ``airflow.install``
via include list. It will also invoke ``airflow.config.flask`` for webserver and authentication.

``airflow.service``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This state will start the airflow service and has a dependency on ``airflow.config``
via include list.

``airflow.clean``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*Meta-state (This is a state that includes other states)*.

this state will undo everything performed in the ``airflow`` meta-state in reverse order, i.e.
stops the service,
removes the configuration file and
then uninstalls the package/archive. ** Not implemented ** placeholder for potential windows support ***

``airflow.service.clean``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This state will stop the airflow service and disable it at boot time.

``airflow.config.clean``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This state will remove the configuration of the airflow service and has a
dependency on ``airflow.service.clean`` via include list.

``airflow.package.clean``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This state will remove the airflow package and has a depency on
``airflow.config.clean`` via include list.

``airflow.archive.clean``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This state will remove the airflow archive and has a depency on
``airflow.config.clean`` via include list.


Available sub-states
--------------------

Various sub-states are available, including:


``airflow.config.flask``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This state will configure the flask-appbuilder configuration file for airflow webservice and ui authentication.


Testing
-------

Linux testing is done with ``kitchen-salt``.

Requirements
^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Ruby
* Docker

.. code-block:: bash

   $ gem install bundler
   $ bundle install
   $ bin/kitchen test [platform]

Where ``[platform]`` is the platform name defined in ``kitchen.yml``,
e.g. ``debian-9-2019-2-py3``.

``bin/kitchen converge``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Creates the docker instance and runs the ``airflow`` main state, ready for testing.

``bin/kitchen verify``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Runs the ``inspec`` tests on the actual instance.

``bin/kitchen destroy``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Removes the docker instance.

``bin/kitchen test``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Runs all of the stages above in one go: i.e. ``destroy`` + ``converge`` + ``verify`` + ``destroy``.

``bin/kitchen login``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Gives you SSH access to the instance for manual testing.
